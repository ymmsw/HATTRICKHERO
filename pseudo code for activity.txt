pseudo code for activity

game idea: A spaceship goes around destroying asteroids within the time limit, make the asteroids collide explodE, explosion sound,we count the collision as a point and  print the point after, then show restart or quit. 

create main class
create a screen using scene
create a background using class scene
load a space image as the background of the scene 
establish sprite in the scene
start game

**after creating the scene then create each sprite and their class to controll sprite*

create the supersprite class usership
create the supersprite class asteroid
both sprite appear when the user hits play

initiate the class usership 
load the image of a spaceship 
set the size to (50, 50) 

create a checkevents methods 
use K_UP to move += y
use K_DOWN to move -= y
use K_LEFT to move -= x
use K_RIGHT to move += x
 

initiate the class asteroid 
load the image of an asteroid 
set the size to (50, 50) 

create a checkevents method
if usership collidesWith(sprite) asteroid, 
	asteroid gets reset
	sound effect plays
	you count it as a score 
set dx, dy of asteroid  
set bound action to bounce 


create a timer class 
create a label for the timer 
set a timeleft method 
timelefft = 30 seconds 
countdown until timeleft = 0
if timeleft = 0 


create a game class
